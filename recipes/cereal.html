        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cereal</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Some people are a bit confused and might tell you to put the milk in first, but this is just flat out wrong.
            Step 1 is to pour some of your favorite cereal from the box into your bowl</li>
        <li>Next, pour the milk of your choice into the bowl</li>
        <li>Enjoy with some saturday morning cartoons</li>
